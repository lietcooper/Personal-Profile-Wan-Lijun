<p>I was born in Nanchang and lived there with my parents. At the age of six, I entered the centennial school,Nanchang Youzheng Rd Elementary School, to begin my first grade. 
  During my time in elementary school, besides studying hard, I developed interests and skills in calligraphy, playing the flute, and swimming, participating in several swimming competitions and achieving notable rankings.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>At the age of 12, I enrolled in the first year of junior high at the Nanchang Foreign Language School and obtained direct advancement qualifications in the second semester of ninth grade, subsequently entering the high school section of the Foreign Language School that same year. 
   Throughout my three years in middle school, I continued swimming and reached the national second-level athlete standard in competitions across Jiangxi Province. In high school, I focused on my studies. 
   Due to residing on campus, I couldn't continue swimming but maintained my physical fitness through activities like running, securing first place in the 1500 meters during the sports meet. 
   In my class, I served as the sports representative, cared for my classmates, loved the collective, and assisted my classmates in various aspects, earning the title of one of the school's Outstanding Students.</p> 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Academically, I participated in various subject competitions, including winning a second-place prize in a city-level chemistry competition. 
  During this period, I also learned to play the guitar, which became a hobby that I pursued in my spare time to enrich my life. After diligent study in my senior year, I obtained a recommendation for direct admission and entered the Department of English at Southeast University in September 2020.</p>
